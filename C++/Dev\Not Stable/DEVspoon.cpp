// Heya!! If you want to play Spoon, you'll have to use an online website.
// You can use these 2 that I recommend!!
// https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler OR https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/
// Copy and paste this code into the terminal and press run!
// If there are any bugs you've found, either tell me if we're at the same school or make an issue on the github!
// **************************************************************************************************************
// If you want to use the actual file without using a website, you can read the README assigned to this Repo. If you find any bugs, make an issue please ^^
